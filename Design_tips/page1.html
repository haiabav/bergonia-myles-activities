    <h2>PAGE 1</h2><br>
<p>Keep your your homepage minimalistic and free of clutter
        your websites homepages should communicate your core message instantaneously. 
        After all, we rarely read word on a website. Instead, we quickly scan the page, 
        picking out key words, sentences and images. With these known behaviors in mind,
        it's to appeal to emotions rather than word count.</p>
